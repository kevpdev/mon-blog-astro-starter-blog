# Component Architecture

## Quick Reference

**🏗️ Detailed architecture**: `.claude/rules/00-architecture/1-astro-architecture-patterns.mdx`  
**📋 Component templates**: `.claude/core/config-templates.mdx`

## Architecture Rules

### Component Organization
```
src/components/
├── ui/         # Pure UI components (no business logic)
└── layout/     # Layout and structural components
```

### Component Standards
- **UI components**: Props interface, TypeScript strict, scoped styles
- **Layout components**: Composable design, slot-based content
- **Smart/dumb pattern**: Logic in parent, display in child

### Design System Integration
- Use design tokens from `src/styles/design-tokens.css`
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent spacing and typography scale

### Performance Rules
- Static generation preferred over SSR
- Selective hydration with `client:` directives
- Image optimization with `<Image>` component

## Component Checklist

- [ ] Props interface defined with TypeScript
- [ ] Responsive design implemented
- [ ] Scoped styles used
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure
- [ ] Accessibility attributes included
- [ ] Design tokens used for consistency

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Generate new component
mkdir src/components/ui/NewComponent
touch src/components/ui/NewComponent.astro

# Test component integration
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```
